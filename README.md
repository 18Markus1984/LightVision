# LightVision

A small raspberry Pi WS2812 RGB LED Matrix project

## Editor
You can import, create or edit a Panel. You have a fill Tool, Color-Picker and an eraser, that reset the complete panel. You have a color pallet you dopple click on the white box and get a color Picker. If you only click ones, you select the color. You can also move and press down the mouse, so you don't need to click for each pixel.

## Animator
You can import, create or edit a Animation. You can import a Picture which only will be added as the current panel, but if you add a gif you create a new animation. The tools are the same as in the Editor for the Panels. The only differnce is the small textBox in the Bottom right which changes the how often a animation is shown.

## Display
The display had many iterations till it finally worked. In the end we used CJMCU-8x8 pcbs. First we tried to figure out a way to use a long LED strip, but the distances between the LEDs where pretty hard to get and the cables always rip of the conntects.
